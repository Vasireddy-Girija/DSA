Three types -
1.Max or min among all possibilities
2.Count all possibilities
3.Check if this is possible or not (true/ false) 

*All subsequence problems can be solved using recursion.
*recursion is a bottom-up approach. Convert all problems to handle with indexes. Base condition - if index reaches n(array length), then return accordingly.

Base conditions - Check if we can have either or both base conditions while solving the problem.
a)Condition which is not possible.
b)Condition which is least possible.
