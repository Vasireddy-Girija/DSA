DP - 
All DP problems are reccursion problems where we have overlapping sub-problems.

Steps in any DP problem -
1.Get the recursive solution.
2.Change the recursive solution to memoization.
3.Create tabulation
4.Space optimisation of tabulation technique.

1D DP - one index


2D DP- two indexes
Type 1: Both index i & j are fixed.
Type 2: Only one of indexes i or j is fixed, other is variable.
Type 3: Both index i and j are variable.

3D DP- 3 indexes
